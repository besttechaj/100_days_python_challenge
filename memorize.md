# Important concept

## loop though the iterator list, string

for in loop :

- to get the element
- Use it whenever you want to do something for each iteration
- for loop is used when the number of iterations is known.
- for loops are safe to use because you already known the no. of times the loop will execute as compared to while loop (may leads to infinite loop with small mistake also ).

for in range :

- to get the index
- Use it whenever you want to do something for each iteration
- for loop is used when the number of iterations is known.
- for loops are safe to use because you already known the no. of times the loop will execute as compared to while loop.

while loop :

- Executes till one condition didn't satisfied
- use it whenever you want to do something based on conditions
- while a while loop is used when you don't know the number of iterations and also execution is done in the while loop until the statement in the program is proved wrong.
- While loop are dangerous to run, because it will run until the conditions didn't become false. A single mistake can leads to crash your application due to infinite loop.
