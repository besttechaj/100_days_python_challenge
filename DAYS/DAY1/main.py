# to acknowledge the written content as a string, we can use the escape character \"
print("hello coder this is day-1 of \"python\" tutorial")

#? to print multiple lines in a single print statement, we can use \n (\n is a newline character, which moves the text after it to the next line.)

#? IndentationError: In python we should write the code from beginning of the line else it will throw you one indentation Error if you give some space before the beginning of the code

#? input function: The input() function is used to take user input in Python. It always returns the input as a string unless explicitly converted to another type.
# input('Enter your name')
# input("Hello, " + input("Enter your name"))

#? Multiple Inputs in One Line: Use split() to take multiple inputs at once.
x, y = input("Enter two numbers: ").split()
x = int(x)
y = int(y)
print("Sum:", x + y)

#? Using eval() for Direct Conversion: Instead of int() or float(), you can use eval() to automatically convert numbers.
x = eval(input("Enter a number: "))
print("You entered:", x)


# len() function: It is used to get the length of the string.
# print(len(input("Enter your name")))

# variables in python: It is used to store the data.Hence we can use the variable to refer the data.
# data = input("Enter your name: ")
# print(data)
